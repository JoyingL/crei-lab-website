# CREI lab website

Static Astro site for the Climate Resilient and Equitable Infrastructure Lab (CREI), Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Tufts University. Working name until Farshid confirms the official English name.

Research notes for this project (`task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `data/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`) live in the same folder and are not the site app.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:4321. Build with `npm run build`; preview the `dist/` output with `npm run preview`.

## Content

Edit Markdown in `src/content/` (people, projects, publications, teaching, news). Empty collections render as “Content forthcoming.” Do not invent a student roster or fake citations.
## Review deployment

Live draft: https://joyingl.github.io/crei-lab-website/

The `main` branch contains website source only. The `gh-pages` branch contains the
built static site and is published by GitHub Pages. Internal research material and
working notes are excluded from this public repository.

Run `npm run check` and `npm run build` before publishing an updated `dist/` to the
`gh-pages` branch. Source changes alone do not update the live website.

Internal links and public assets use `src/lib/paths.ts` for the
`/crei-lab-website` deployment base.

The decorative world map uses public-domain Natural Earth 1:110m land geometry (https://www.naturalearthdata.com/). It illustrates geography only, not project coverage.

Institutional marks are supplied Tufts University and Civil and Environmental Engineering white logo assets. The CEE header image is cropped to its department text, omitting the repeated Tufts mark and divider, as requested; its text proportions are preserved.

Projects currently uses three editorial placeholders; funding records are excluded from public project listings and site search.
